# System Design Canvas

A one-page overview of the system architecture, requirements, and design choices.

## 1. Users / Actors
Who interacts with the system?  
- [User type 1: description]  
- [User type 2: description]  
- [External system / API]  

---

## 2. Use Cases / Requirements
What problems are we solving? What scenarios must the system support?  
- [Use case 1]  
- [Use case 2]  
- [Use case 3]  

---

## 3. Inputs & Outputs
What data flows in, what comes out?  
- **Inputs**: [e.g., user profile data, uploaded files]  
- **Outputs**: [e.g., analytics dashboard, email notifications]  

---

## 4. Core Components / Services
Break down the system into main building blocks.  
- [Frontend application]  
- [Backend API]  
- [Authentication service]  
- [Database]  

---

## 5. Data & Storage
What needs to be stored? How is it structured?  
- [Database type: relational / NoSQL / other]  
- [Entities: e.g., users, projects, invoices]  
- [Special considerations: indexing, caching]  

---

## 6. Integrations
External systems, APIs, or libraries the system depends on.  
- [Payment provider]  
- [Email service]  
- [3rd-party authentication]  

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
Key system qualities (even at small scale).  
- **Performance**: [response time goals]  
- **Scalability**: [vertical / horizontal]  
- **Security**: [auth, data protection]  
- **Availability**: [uptime expectations]  

---

## 8. Infrastructure / Deployment
How and where the system runs.  
- **Hosting**: [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS]  
- **Deployment**: [manual / CI/CD pipeline]  
- **Containers**: [Docker? yes/no]  
- **Monitoring/Logging**: [tools if used]  

---

## 9. System Diagram (Optional)
Sketch a simple diagram of the system architecture.  
> You can embed an image here (draw in Excalidraw, Miro, or by hand, then upload).

## 10. Future Considerations
Possible extensions or scaling strategies.  
- [Idea 1]  
- [Idea 2]  
- [Idea 3]
