# Scope of document

This document is supposed to collect the experience along the development process.

I decided to write down my thought process and experience, because I wanted to understand why I felt uneasy about my progress and I am regularly questioning my approach. So up until Aug-26, 2025 the log is written from my memory. 

# Log

## Starting context and history August 2025

The owner of a wine bar that a visit occasionally told me about spending roughly 7000 Euro per year on new glassware, because guests do not return the glasses they use-- and they are allowed to take their drink outside. The owner estimated 90 of glasses not being returned. The bar is located in Berlin, Germany. 

Establishing the usual deposit did not seem feasible from the owner's perspective. I understood that such solution would slow down the payment process, because the gets very busy during opening hours (up to 5 or 6 am in the morning), especially during summer times.

Aug-13, 2025. On the way to meeting my girlfriend I thought about the glassware issue of the mentioned wine bar. I wondered if there is a possibility how to digitalize the deposit without interfering with the payment process or the workflow at the bar. The typical event venue/bar deposit focuses on making people return their glassware, because they want to get back their additionally spent money. So not returning feels like a loss. I thought that there may be another motivation: An incentive to motivate people return glassware by themselves actively, e.g. a gamified approach. 

So, on Aug-15, 2025, I asked ChatGPT for a web search on digital glassware deposit apps or projects. It did not find anything.

Since I was on a the look for a new job with a focus on data analysis and programming, I decided to take the realization of my idea as a personal project and use it for the following purposes
* show myself that I can take a project from idea to prototype
* showcase a project for application purposes
* show the prototype to the bar owner I learned the problem from
* work on something that makes me feel productive and that I can control

I wanted to meet one major requirement: Exert the least possible interference with the payment process for the bar crew and guests.
